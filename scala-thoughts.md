- What's easy to do in Scala? What's not?

We liked pattern matching and collection manipulation. Scala allows for succinct code without excessive constructs/conditionals. 
The 'embarrassment of riches' makes it difficult to know what is appropriate in a given situation. For example, nested loops and higher order functions can achieve the same end goal, for the most part.

- What is/are your favorite language design choice(s) that the designers of Scala made? Why?

The Underscore (Pattern matching.) But seriously. It makes expressing your intent in code very clean and straightforward.

- What is/are your least favorite language design choice(s)? Why? And why do you think the designers made that / those choice(s)?

The mix of Object Oriented and functional styles makes Scala more difficult to reason about, due to the introduction of side effects in functional paradigms. This probably came from DSLs, as it allows for pretty much limitless expressiveness, and variable control flow.

- What Scala features would you like to learn more about?

Option (monads) are new to Chloe so they're intriguing. Matt is curious about what Scala features are specifically geared for the creation of DSLs, as that might influence the type of DSL he'd like to build.
